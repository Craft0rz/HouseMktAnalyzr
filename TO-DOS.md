## Review Expense Assumptions - 2026-02-08 09:50

- **Audit expense calculation assumptions against real-world data** - Current expense ratios are hardcoded estimates; verify against industry standards and find real data sources where possible. **Problem:** The calculator uses rough percentages (insurance 0.4% of price, maintenance 8% of rent in backend / 5% in frontend, vacancy 2% in backend / 5% in frontend, total expense ratio 35%) with no sourcing. Frontend and backend assumptions don't even match. Need to validate against what Quebec real estate investors actually use and find authoritative data sources (CMHC vacancy rates, insurance broker averages, municipal tax rates from open data). **Files:** `src/housemktanalyzr/analysis/calculator.py:21-25` (DEFAULT_EXPENSE_RATIOS), `frontend/src/components/PropertyDetail.tsx:281-287` (frontend cash flow breakdown), `src/housemktanalyzr/analysis/calculator.py:154-195` (expense calculation methods). **Solution:** Research CMHC vacancy rates by zone (already partially done), Quebec landlord insurance averages, typical maintenance reserves (capex vs opex), and compare with APCHQ/CORPIQ guidelines. Reconcile frontend and backend values. Consider making assumptions user-configurable or at least transparent in the UI.


## Hochelaga Safety Score 0/10 - 2026-02-08 09:50

- **Investigate Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve safety score of 0** - Borough returns safety=0 which seems extreme even for a higher-crime area. **Problem:** The safety scoring formula `max(0, min(10, 10 - (ratio * 5)))` clamps to 0 when crime ratio >= 2x the city average. Hochelaga has 5,061 crimes vs city avg ~1,600, so ratio ~3.2 → score = 10 - 16 = clamped to 0. This may be correct (it IS the highest-crime borough) but a score of exactly 0 feels harsh and could unfairly penalize listings. The formula uses raw crime counts, not per-capita rates. MHM is the largest borough by population (~175k), so its raw count is inflated compared to smaller boroughs. **Files:** `src/housemktanalyzr/enrichment/montreal_data.py:489-497` (safety score formula), `src/housemktanalyzr/analysis/calculator.py:431-480` (calculate_location_score using safety_score). **Solution:** Consider normalizing by population (per-capita crime rate) instead of raw counts; or adjust the scoring curve to avoid hard 0s (e.g., floor at 1). Check if SPVM publishes per-capita stats or if we can pull population from census data.
