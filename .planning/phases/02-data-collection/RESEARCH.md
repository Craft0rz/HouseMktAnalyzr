# Research: Data Sources for Greater Montreal Real Estate

## Objective
Identify available data sources for residential property listings in Greater Montreal, focusing on:
- Houses, duplexes, triplexes, and multi-unit buildings
- Pricing, property details, and rental income data
- API access vs. web scraping requirements

## Research Questions

1. **Centris (Quebec MLS)**
   - Is there a public API?
   - What are access requirements (broker credentials, fees)?
   - Data available (listings, historical prices, rental data)?

2. **Realtor.ca**
   - Public API availability?
   - Terms of service for data access?
   - Coverage for Quebec properties?

3. **Third-party APIs**
   - RapidAPI real estate options for Canada
   - Data aggregators (Zillow, Redfin - do they cover Canada?)
   - Any Quebec-specific data providers?

4. **Alternative Sources**
   - CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation) data
   - Rentals.ca for rental price data
   - Municipal assessment data (City of Montreal)

5. **Web Scraping Feasibility**
   - Legal considerations for Quebec
   - Technical difficulty
   - Rate limiting and anti-bot measures
